# Romantic Website Project: A Digital Valentine's Gift

A simple yet elegant frontend web project created as a digital Valentine's Day gift. This project demonstrates the fundamental use of **HTML5** and **CSS3** to create a personal, visual, and interactive user experience.



## ‚ú® About the Project

This website is designed as a modern digital greeting card. Instead of a traditional paper card, this project presents greetings, a gallery of memories, and a poem in a beautiful and responsive web page format. It's a practical example of how web technologies can be used to convey a personal message in a creative and memorable way.

The project is structured into several main sections:
* **Hero Page:** An initial welcome with an engaging video background.
* **Main Menu:** Navigation that directs users to different sections of the site.
* **Greeting Card:** A sincere, personal message presented alongside a relevant image.
* **Gallery:** A collection of photos displayed in a clean grid layout.
* **Poem:** A presentation of poetic text with a design focused on readability.
* **A Little Gift:** A bonus page with a sweet CSS heart animation.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

This project is built purely with core web technologies, showcasing the fundamental power of:

* **HTML5:** For the structure and semantic content of each page.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, layout, animations, and responsive design.

## üåü Key Features

* **Responsive Design:** Built using `@media` queries to ensure an optimal display on various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.
* **Video Background:** Implements the HTML5 `<video>` tag for a dynamic and immersive background on the main page.
* **Modern Layout:** Utilizes **CSS Flexbox** and **Grid** to efficiently and neatly arrange content like the greeting card and photo gallery.
* **CSS Animations & Transitions:**
    * Smooth `hover` effects on buttons and navigation links for visual feedback.
    * A heart (love sign) animation created purely with CSS `@keyframes`, adding a sweet touch to the "Lil Gift" page.
* **Custom Typography:** Uses Google Fonts to enhance the aesthetics and readability of the text throughout the site.
* **Smooth Scrolling:** The use of `scroll-behavior: smooth;` in CSS for a seamless transition when users click on internal navigation links.
